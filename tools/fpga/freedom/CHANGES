This Github repo from SiFive is open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. 
A copy of this license can be found in this directory. Apache 2.0 requires 
us to state the changes made to the original code. So here are our changes:

1. Increase the ITIM cache from 8KB to 32KB.

2. Increase the DTIM cache from 16KB to 128KB.

3. Increase the clock frequency from 32MHz to 65MHz.

4. Change RocketCoreParams to enable user-mode by setting useUser to true.

5. The SPI1 bus controller (0x10024000) was mapped to the ChipKit SPI pins 
on the Arty board. We changed this mapping to the Pmod1 pins on the board, 
in order to connect the processor with the microSD card.
