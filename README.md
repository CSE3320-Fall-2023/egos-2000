## Vision

This project's vision is to help **every** college student read **all** the code of an operating system.

With only **2000** lines of code, egos-2000 implements every component of an operating system for education. 
It can run on a RISC-V board and also the QEMU software emulator.

## Earth and Grass Operating System

egos-2000 was developed as a new teaching OS for CS5411/4411 at Cornell. It adopts a 3-layer architecture.

* The **earth layer** implements hardware-specific abstractions.
    * tty and disk device interfaces
    * interrupt and memory management interfaces
* The **grass layer** implements hardware-independent abstractions.
    * processes, system calls and inter-process communications
* The **application layer** implements file system, shell and user commands.

The definitions of `struct earth` and `struct grass` in [this header file](library/egos.h) specify the layer interfaces.

### Usages and Documentation

For compiling and running egos-2000, please read [this document](COMPILING.md).
The [RISC-V instruction set manual](references/riscv-privileged-v1.10.pdf) and [SiFive FE310 manual](references/sifive-fe310-v19p04.pdf) introduce the privileged ISA and processor memory map.
[This document](references/README.md) further introduces the teaching plans, architecture and development history.
